401-Database-Test-App
=====================

This application is a test in HTML5 utilizing Javascript functions to initialize 
a local SQLite database, prepopulating with generic Data, and updating row with 
additional data.

You can use this github repository to create a PhoneGap build.  So far, I have
been able to create a simple Android application, but IOS applications will
require an Apple Developers account for a secure key.
